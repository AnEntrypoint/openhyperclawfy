## What is Hyperfy?

Hyperfy is an open-source framework for building interactive 3D virtual worlds. It combines a powerful physics engine, networked real-time collaboration, and a component-based application system to create immersive experiences that can be self-hosted or connected to the wider Hyperfy ecosystem.

## 🧬 Key Features

- **Standalone persistent worlds** - Host on your own domain
- **Realtime content creation** - Build directly in-world
- **Interactive app system** - Create dynamic applications with JavaScript
- **Portable avatars** - Connect via Hyperfy for consistent identity
- **Physics-based interactions** - Built on PhysX for realistic simulation
- **WebXR support** - Experience worlds in VR
- **Extensible architecture** - Highly customizable for various use cases

**Tech Stack:** Node.js 22.11.0+, Three.js, PhysX (WASM), Fastify, React 19, esbuild

## 🧩 Use Cases

- **Virtual Events & Conferences** - Host live gatherings with spatial audio
- **Interactive Showrooms** - Create product displays and demos
- **Social Spaces** - Build community hubs for collaboration
- **Gaming Environments** - Design immersive game worlds
- **Educational Experiences** - Develop interactive learning spaces
- **Creative Showcases** - Display 3D art and interactive installations

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.11.0+ (via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or direct install)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy.git my-world
cd my-world

# Copy example environment settings (and set to your own values)
cp .env.example .env

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Now visit `localhost:3000` in your browser to jump in!

### Docker Deployment

For containerized deployment, check [DOCKER.md](DOCKER.md) for detailed instructions.

### World Folder

Every edit you make in the world is saved to your world folder which makes it easy to backup/restore.
A local SQLite db stores all world settings and transforms for apps, and the assets folder includes all uploaded assets.
You can also have multiple world folders and switch between them by changing the `WORLD` environment variable.
